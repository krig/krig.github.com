<h1 id="futurism">Futurism</h1>

<p>Walking through the city where I live, I started thinking about the
relationship between the people who live in this city and the city
itself. Is the city really built to be a home to these people, or is
the purpose of the city something else? Are we just parasites in a
larger organism which in turn is what shapes the city?</p>

<p>I realised that a city is actuallly a place that is quite hostile to
human life. It is criss-crossed with roads filled with deadly
vehicles, that one has to spend constant effort avoiding while moving
through the city. There are signs everywhere telling you what not to
do and where not to go. Any door you can see is most likely locked and
inaccessible to you.</p>

<p>In fact, to me it seems as if the city is actually home to some other
creature: Corporations, not humans.</p>

<p>Humans suffocate in cities. Corporations thrive. Small, human-centric
stores and companies are driven out of business by multinational
conglomerates, franchises and corporations. The city is constantly
becoming less and less accessible to humanity.</p>

<p>CCTV eyes watch the human vermin as it crawls in its own filth, trying
to avoid the rage of the corporate machine whose wheels crush humanity
on expanding highways.</p>

<h1 id="singularity">Singularity?</h1>

<p>I've read about the singularity concept for a long time, and I think
it's an intriguing idea. Basically, the pace of innovation and
technical development seems to be speeding up at an exponential rate,
and by extending this exponential curve of technologial advance into
the future, you reach a point of singularity (some 10-15 years ahead
or so), where the pace is too high to measure.</p>

<p>The idea is that at some point, we will be able to build a machine
that is smarter than ourselves, which in turn is able to build another
machine that is smarter than it, and that this process will continue,
faster and faster, with machines that have increasing levels of
intelligence.</p>

<p>Now, I think that this idea is intriguing, but I don't think saying
that since the pace has been exponential before, it will continue to
be such forever. (I apologize if I am putting up a strawman here, but
this is how I've understood the theory). I don't see why that has to
be the case. I remember going to school and reading about how at the
year 2000 we'd be 10 billion people on earth and there would be a huge
overpopulation problem. Well, it's 2009 now, we're not 10 billion
people on earth, and people are still worrying about
overpopulation. This is not to say that overpopulation isn't a real
problem. Just that what seems to be an inevitable trend might not be.</p>

<p>However, I think there has already been a singularity of sorts. I
think that humans are not, in fact, the highest form of life at all. I
think that human society is a living organism, and the only reason
this seems absurd to us is because we are the cells in the body of the
organism and can't see the forest for the trees.</p>

<h1 id="corporations">Corporations</h1>

<p>The prevalence of fascism and totalitarianism seems, to me, to be
central in this. Yes, fascism is bad for individual humans and bad for
freedom and happiness among people. But to the corporate organism,
perhaps totalitarianism among its cells is a benificial evolutionary
trait? Just as we wouldn't want our cells to have absolute autonomy
but would rather, in fact, prefer to have dictatorial control of our
own bodies - so, perhaps, does the corporate entity prefer control of
its constituent parts over limbs with autonomous control and desire.</p>

<p>The next question, then, is this: Are humans essential to the
corporate entity? I would say that they are not. If ships can deliver
goods autonomously and the stock market can trade via software, at
some point the human can be taken out of the equation. Perhaps
remaining as goods to be traded on the market. </p>

<p>This, however, is not to say that the revolution was when computers
replaced humans. I think that shows faulty reasoning. Yes, software
will some day allow society to function without humanity. But the key
development was developing an autonomous higher lifeform (the
corporation or cultural entity).</p>

<p>Cities are not the homes of humans. Cities are the dwellings of the
corporate monsters that are killing humanity.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this: A city could be, first and foremost, a
human-friendly place. The heart of the city could be parks, places to
walk, cafees serving free drinks and food, free transportation,
convenient housing...</p>

<p>It is not, though, is it? The premium space in a city is taken up by
roads, developed to efficiently transport goods. Why?</p>

<p>It's easy to look at corporations as evil and unfriendly to human
life because they are controlled by profit-driven people. This is like
saying that the human body is controlled by individual brain
cells, and that these individual cells are what directs the
human. It's missing the transcendent intelligence.  The corporation
has a will and motion of its own, which is beyond the control of the
individual (even a CEO cannot do whatever she wants).</p>

<p>The company is the new humanity.</p>
