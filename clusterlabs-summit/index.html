    <h1>Clusterlabs Summit 2017</h1>
    <div class="postdate">Sep 7, 2017</div>
    <p>In 2017, I organized a conference for the first and only time. This was the
<a href="https://www.clusterlabs.org">Clusterlabs</a> semi-regular developer conference for
the Linux HA / Clusterlabs community. It was generally a success, attended by
people from various companies and places, and surprisingly not a terrible amount
of work to arrange. This despite the fact that the conference was held in
Nuremberg, Germany while I live in Sweden and work remotely.</p>

<p>There is a really nice write-up of the conference by Tanja from SUSE
<a href="https://www.suse.com/c/art-clustering-dinos-elephants-clusterlabs-summit-nuremberg-2017/">here</a>.</p>
