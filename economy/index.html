<h1 id="thefallofsomekindofempire">The fall of some kind of empire</h1>

<p>I am not an economist. That doesn't mean I can't have an opinion
though. Sure, my predictions are probably going to turn out to be
wrong. Since my predictions are pretty gloomy, that can't really be a
bad thing, though.</p>

<p>So. Right now (that is, late spring of 2009), there is a global
economic crisis rolling over the world. The cracks of the financial
bubble started showing, and everyone got scared, and here we are. Well,
it's not <strong>actually</strong> that bad yet. Not that many people have lost
their jobs, and the housing prices here in sweden, despite being at
ridiculously high levels, keep on rising.</p>

<p>Some people have even started saying that it's all over, back to the
glory days.</p>

<p>Here is my bold prediction: The economic collapse has only
begun. Clearly, no one knows where this is going. Economists try to
make guesses based on the stories they tell themselves, and clearly
the guesses of economists are not accurate predictors. For one thing,
there is a nice Heisenberg effect in that if the economists in general
are positive, that in itself will cause optimism that may or may not
be realistic. So if the general opinion of the future is negative,
that will affect the real outcome of things. Clearly, such a complex
feedback system makes it very precarious to try to speak to future
states with any degree of certainty.</p>

<p>Never mind that though, I'm giving it a try. For one, I don't think
anyone listens to what I have to say.</p>

<p>Globally, here is what I predict:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>America is irrelevant going forward. The dollar will cease to be the
dominant currency world-wide.</p></li>
<li><p>The same housing crisis that has ravaged the United States will
strike in Europe as well.</p></li>
<li><p>The giant ball of money that has been printed and is sitting in the
banks too afraid to lend them out will eventually start finding its
way onto the market, with inflation panic following in its wake.</p></li>
<li><p>Inflation.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Locally (as in sweden), my major expectation is that housing prices
will plummet. Right now, I think that the turning point will be at a
general price level of 55% of the peak.</p>

<p>For one, I think it is laughable when economists make optimistic
noises about the recovery of the economy, while knowing that most of
the impact of the rising unemployment has yet to strike. Sony Ericsson
and Ericsson are doing exceptionally poorly, just like Volvo and
Saab. Sure, IKEA seems to be doing well, but pretty much all the other
major swedish industrial companies are on the brink of collapse. Also,
I don't know much about the state of the baltic economies, but it
doesn't seem terribly unlikely that collapses there can topple at
least some of the big swedish banks. Oh, and I do predict inflation
here as well.</p>
