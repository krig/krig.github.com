    <h1>Hawk API server</h1>
    <div class="postdate">Jan 11, 2020</div>
    <p>My relationship with Go so far has been that it's a language that I don't love and
don't want to love, but which I find myself being effortlessly productive in, in
a way that I haven't experienced with a lot of other languages unless I have
years of experience with them.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/hawk-apiserver">Hawk API server</a> is an
example of that. For the HA stack, we had been using <code>lighttpd</code> as the web
server for <a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/hawk">Hawk</a>, the web frontend for the
HA cluster stack.</p>
<p>Instead of switching to Apache which would cause headaches since we're also
hosting Apache has a cluster service, I started playing around with writing a
minimal web server in Go. At first my plan was to use some already existing web
server like Caddy, but I basically had a fully functional implementation working
already after my initial hack session.</p>
<p>Since then, the API server has gained a lot of interesting features. We use a
persistent connection to Pacemaker together with goroutines for each API call to
enable instant refresh of the web UI on cluster changes. I analyse the initial
bytes of the HTTP connection to see if it's HTTP or HTTPS, and respond to HTTP
with a redirect to HTTPS: That way, someone can type in the <code>IP:PORT</code> directly
into the browser location bar without adding <code>https://</code> in front and it'll still
work correctly.</p>
