<div id="content">
<h1 id="softwarefreedom">Software freedom</h1>

<p>I have moved from using Windows to Linux in the last year, and I
thought I'd write down some of the problems and thoughts I've had so
far. I'm going to loosely structuring this by action, that is: surfing,
programming, listening to music etc.</p>

<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>

<p>Since I work as a programmer, the biggest change for me was moving
from working in Visual Studio to working in the Unix ecosystem of
tools. Writing software for Windows, you pretty much have one single
tool for every need. VS is a text editor, debugger, project manager
and compiler, all rolled into one. In Linux, it's not quite so
simple. Instead of moving to KDevelop or something similar that tries
to emulate the VS experience, I switched to writing my code in
<a href="../emacs/">emacs</a>, plus a whole shitload of other tools.</p>

<h3 id="texteditor">Text editor</h3>

<p>I've ended up using <a href="../emacs/">emacs</a> as my text editor in Linux. <a href="../emacs/">emacs</a> is amazing
once you get used to it. For most things you want a text editor to do,
there is someone who has written some ELisp to do just that. Plus tons
of stuff you never thought you'd want or use, but that end up being
used over and over.</p>

<p>If I switched back to working in Windows again some day, I'd still
keep using <a href="../emacs/">emacs</a> over any other text editor.</p>

<h3 id="projectmanagement">Project management</h3>

<p>Well, this is something that really hurts in Linux. Right now, I'm
using something called waf to manage my builds, but it is far from
perfect. At least it's not autotools.</p>

<p>Starting out, I got frustrated enough to start writing my own build
system, and I got Casey Muratori to release his build system but then
never ended up using it (maybe I will, some day). I simply don't know
of anything that really works. Then again, Visual Studio is horribly
broken as a project management system as well, so there's nothing new
there.</p>

<h3 id="versioncontrol">Version control</h3>

<p>I ended up moving from using Perforce to using <a href="../git/">git</a>, more due to
switching workplaces than personal preference. Now, however, I've seen
the light, and I use <a href="../git/">git</a> for all my personal projects. Distributed
version control truly is superior to any centralized model.</p>

<p>I'll write more about <a href="../git/">git</a> some other time.</p>

<h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3>

<p>GDB is no Visual Studio.. by a longshot. The debugger is one thing that I
haven't been able to find a decent replacement for in Linux. There's
Nemiver which tries to put makeup on GDB, but it's more of a scary
clown than anything else at this point.</p>

<p>In the end, I end up relying more on testing than debugging.</p>
