    <h1>Oferlund</h1>
    <div class="postdate">Mar 1, 2020</div>
    <p>I recently bought a little synthesizer/groovebox called <a href="https://teenage.engineering">OP-Z</a> by Teenage Engineering. It's tiny and limited, but a ton of fun and somehow the limitations work for me - I find myself actually creating music with it.</p>
<p>During January, I participated in something called <code>#jamuary</code> on instagram. Basically I created and posted a little musical clip every day. Sometimes it was part of a song, sometimes just a little jam, but I did manage to post something every day.</p>
<p>Once January was done, I started thinking about turning these jams into a &ldquo;real&rdquo; album. Of course it's self-published and unprofessionally mastered and so on, but still.</p>
<p>I'm calling the project <em>Oferlund</em> and the album <em>Vemod</em>, it should be out on all of the major streaming services in mid March, and it consists of 9 tracks and 45 minutes of music.</p>
<p>Here's the cover:</p>

<p>It's possible that this music appeals to no one except myself. Still, I do like it, and that's enough for me.</p>
