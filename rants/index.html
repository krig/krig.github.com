<h2 id="commentssuck.">Comments suck.</h2>

<p>This site is written in <a href="http://ikiwiki.info/" title="ikiwiki">ikiwiki</a>. Generally speaking, ikiwiki is
like an offline wiki that you can upload to the web. It's a piece of
software that takes a pile of text documents and some configuration
settings, and compiles it into a set of HTML pages. Very static. Very
old-school. Apparently there is some way to allow dynamic content on
an ikiwiki site through a CGI script. CGI! When was the last time you
heard anyone mention that?</p>

<p>Ikiwiki is certainly not web 2.0. There is nothing social or community
about it. That is a good thing.</p>

<h2 id="onideasandspeakingthem">On ideas and speaking them</h2>

<p>There seems to be a law of nature that says that <em>only idiots write comments</em>.</p>

<p>Youtube and the absolute horror of the comments there is the obvious
example, but this phenomenon can be observed all over the web. Even on
obscure technical forums people are quick to degenerate into
slobbering idiocy when trying to express their ideas. And yes, I do
see the irony in being angry and ranty and all this and ranting about
idiots writing comments online.</p>

<p>Now, this wouldn't really be a problem unless I suffered from the
compulsion of having to read the comments whenever I accidentally come
across them. This is not good for my blood pressure.</p>

<p>Thus, I am setting a new trend. It is time to move on from this system
of letting anyone ejaculate their poorly formulated blabber all over
articles just to appeal to some naive idea of a social community. No
comments for you.</p>

<h2 id="oncloudsandfreedom">On clouds (and freedom)</h2>

<p>Cloud computing is the death of freedom. Let me talk about
Google. Google has a slogan that says that they will <a href="http://ablog.apress.com/?p=1019" title="do no evil">"do no evil"</a>. </p>

<p>Well, first of all - isn't advertising the ultimate
evil? Spam, banner ads and relentless commercialism is the foundation
of the sewers of modern society. It's through the pipes of Google
Adwords that the toxic waste of the digital age flows. </p>

<p>Second of all,
I would say that it is not exactly benevolent to concentrate the
private data of individuals through deceptively simple interfaces on
their servers, so that someone can be cut off from their own documents
without reason? Google has already helped the Chinese government
harrass and arrest dissidents. What if they one day decide to share
the contents of the accounts of every chinese citizen with the
government. They might claim that this is something they had to do, no
choice, we're not evil, no sir. </p>

<p>The point is that they have the
ability to do this to begin with. Oh, not to speak of the US
government. Obama has suggested that he wishes to enable indefinite
incarceration of people who have committed no crimes, but who are
believed to be very likely to commit crimes in the future. Read that
sentence again. Suddenly it's freely up to some government official to
decide that you might one day commit a crime, and therefore lock you
up <em>indefinitely</em> without even receiving a mock trial as comfort. </p>

<p>Make no mistake. Google is definitely evil.</p>
