<div id="content">
<h1 id="supernatural">Supernatural</h1>

<p>I do not believe in the supernatural. That doesn't mean that it
doesn't fascinate me. Ever since I was small, I've always loved to
read about ghosts, telekinesis and life on other planets. Now, you
might say that this doesn't make me very exceptional, in fact you
might claim that most people wouldn't consider unicorns and goblins
as anything real.</p>

<p>There is one form of belief in the supernatural, however, that most
people accept without much questioning. That is, when it is presented
as religion. You would think it quite odd of me to worship Mithra or
Ba'al, but when someone thanks "god" for letting them win the lottery,
that is just par for the course.</p>

<p>Why is this?</p>

<p>Why is religion accepted these days? Don't we know better? I mean,
it's okay for someone who doesn't know about atoms and gravity and
lasers to think that it follows from A) I make things, and B) there
are things, that C) someone must have made them. That is not a level
of reasoning that is acceptable for someone who has at least a
rudimentary education.</p>

<h3 id="themeaningoflife">The meaning of life</h3>

<p>Here is how I see it: Objectively, there is no meaning. There is no
great reason for things to be the way they are. The reason good people
die and bad people get rich, that babies suffer and rapists
triumph.. is not the obscure will of some malevolent sky-father. It's
just the way things have turned out, for better and worse. Now, for
me, this creates hope. I don't understand the people who can look at
this world and the state of current affairs and think "God made this,
how nice of him." Yeah, he was being real nice when he created
poisonous snakes and parasites that swim up the urethra, and I
especially like how he made that appendix of mine infect and burst at
one point, something that would have killed me if it wasn't for
satanic science coming to the rescue.</p>

<p>The reason all this gives me hope, however, is that since there is no
god with some great plan and there is no layed out direction for
things to take, <strong>I can change things.</strong> I can make things better.</p>

<p>Thus, as long as I live my life as well as I can, and try to do the
right thing for those I care about, that's about all I can hope for. I
don't have some naive expectation of the heavenly father recognizing
my extraordinary level of faith and elevating me to some position of
grandeur. This life is as good as it gets, and I try to live it as
well as I can.</p>
