    <h1>Roam</h1>

    <p>Here, at the very last day of 2019, I thought I should start a series of posts documenting some of the hobby
projects I&rsquo;ve created through the years. Most of them can be found on <a href="https://github.com/krig">github</a>,
at least the ones that are in source code form.</p>

<p><code>R O A M</code> was a Hackweek project at SUSE, in which I wanted to implement a basic Minecraft-style landscape
renderer in C. Source code available at <a href="https://github.com/krig/roam">github.com/krig/roam</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the code was written during that week in October 2014, and since then I&rsquo;ve mostly just fixed little bugs
or made small tweaks to the code.</p>

<p>I probably won&rsquo;t continue work on this code base, but my ambition is to start a similar project in Rust at some point.</p>
