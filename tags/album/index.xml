      <description>I recently bought a little synthesizer/groovebox called OP-Z by Teenage Engineering. It&#39;s tiny and limited, but a ton of fun and somehow the limitations work for me - I find myself actually creating music with it.
During January, I participated in something called #jamuary on instagram. Basically I created and posted a little musical clip every day. Sometimes it was part of a song, sometimes just a little jam, but I did manage to post something every day.</description>
