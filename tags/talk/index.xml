      <description>FOSS North, 2019. Second revision of this talk.
I tried to address some of the comments I received after presenting at linux.conf.au earlier the same year. Possibly not entirely successful.</description>

      <description>Presentation I did at linux.conf.au 2019 about the history of Lisp, computers and programming in general.
Got written up as an article on LWN.net to my delight, and so far the comments have generally been surprisingly positive pretty much everywhere.
On April 7 (2019), I will be doing an updated version of this talk at FOSS North in Gothenburg - my time slot is 15 minutes longer, so I might actually get through most of the talk this time.</description>
