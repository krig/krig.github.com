<h1 id="xmlsucks">xml sucks</h1>

<p>The current state of the web is tearinducingly horrible. The whole
web-application situation is so terrible that only functionally
handicapped people could be excited about it. The software of today is
slow, buggy, ugly and unable to do the things computers could do in
the mid-eighties. XML is a horrible, horrible standard, and everything
built on top of it takes the idiocy to higher and higher levels.</p>

<p>There is nothing XML does that other systems don't do better.</p>

<p>First of all, www itself is a shitty standard. HTML is not a good
markup language, and the URL is a horrible addressing
standard. "http://"? Fuck you.</p>

<p>Second of all, what is the purpose of XML? Is it meant to be</p>

<ul>
<li>A human-readable data format?</li>
<li>An efficient data transport protocol?</li>
<li>A data specification language?</li>
<li>A software platform?</li>
<li>A database format?</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't know. XML is not good at any of these. In fact, XML is pretty
much the worst possible solution to each and every one of the problems
it pretends to solve.</p>

<p>XML is</p>

<ul>
<li>Totally and utterly unreadable by any human who isn't dead inside.</li>
<li>Verbose beyond the point of ridicule. "Inefficient" doesn't even
begin to cover it.</li>
<li>Absolutely inappropriate as a definition language.</li>
<li>Incredibly, mindblowingly unsuitable for expressing programming
constructs.</li>
<li>"XML Database". Please. NO. You <em>have</em> to be joking.</li>
<li>Evil. The cost of generating, transporting and parsing XML causes
computers across the world to use way more energy than they have
to, ultimately causing natural disasters and killing puppies across
the world. SATAN LOVES XML.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="humanreadableno.">human readable? no.</h2>

<p>Perhaps XML could be seen as a human readable alternative to binary
protocols or unstructured data, by someone who has never seen another
alternative. It seems that everyone involved in defining web standards
were either living in caves since the fifties, born about five years
before getting their jobs, or lacking basic abilities to read. I
suspect all three options apply. In fact, I am certain they do.</p>

<p>Surely anyone who ever actually tried to parse the bracket-strewn
excrement that is an XML document would have seen how it is an
absolute failure on this point.</p>

<h2 id="goodfordatatransportno.">good for data transport? no.</h2>

<p>Seriously, the web is shit. Everything that is being done now to try
to develop the internet as a platform for all kinds of things is
idiotic. You can't build towers of shit on foundations of shit and
expect to get anything other than shit. Do people seriously think that
any piece of software that is expressed through XML, javascript, CSS,
AJAX and whatever other horrible little stupidity someone managed to
shoehorn into the browser is actually going to be usable?</p>

<p>Here's a newsflash: It's not! These things will always suck! And the
worst part is that distributed software is a <em>solved problem</em>.</p>

<p>There is nothing good about bloating a simple RPC call to 2000
characters using SOAP. There is nothing being expressed there except
the utter idiocy of whoever thought of the idea. You are not solving
any problems with your namespaces and schemas. You are the problem.</p>

<h2 id="dataspecification">data specification</h2>

<p>Let me show a simple example of an application where XML is absolutely
wrong. Don't take this to mean that XML is ever right. It isn't.</p>

<p>This is taken from <code>/etc/fonts/conf.avail/10-antialias.conf</code> on my
Ubuntu system. This is a file used to specify how fonts are to be
antialiased on the screen.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd"&gt;
&lt;fontconfig&gt;
&lt;!--  Use the Antialiasing --&gt; 
  &lt;match target="font"&gt;
    &lt;edit name="antialias" mode="assign"&gt;&lt;bool&gt;true&lt;/bool&gt;&lt;/edit&gt;
  &lt;/match&gt;
&lt;/fontconfig&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What this file is trying to say is <code>antialias = true</code>. Can you see
where in there it actually says that antialias should be true? It
takes a while, right? Wow.</p>

<p>That is epic. If the person who came up with this configuration system
ever reads this, here's a golf clap for you. Well done, sir. You are a
complete jackass.</p>

<p>Let me analyse this file in further detail. First of all, it carefully
uses one line in the file to say that this is an XML document, and
that the version is "1.0". 1.0 of what? Of the document? No, that's
not what they mean. This means it is written using the XML format,
1.0. What would the program trying to read this file do if this number
was changed, to say 1.5? When is it ever going to be a problem that
the version of XML has changed? Will there ever be an XML 1.1? What
would it look like? I don't even want to picture it. In fact, I am
sure that anything I can dream up can't even begin to approximate the
horror of whatever reality turns out to result in this number being
bumped up a notch.</p>

<p>The file then goes on to use way too much text to declare that there
is another document describing the structure of this document called
"fonts.dtd.". What does SYSTEM there mean? Why is it relevant? What
possible word could there be in that place that would change this
line? Could this line possibly have said <code>doctype = "fonts.dtd"</code>. No,
clearly not. Is there a coherent explanation why? Of course not. Also,
what use is this doctype file? Is any human ever going to refer to
that document when editing this file? No, of course not. It's an XML
document, it's unreadable by humans! Clearly the idea is that hey,
this document is just too convoluted to edit by hand. We need to make
it possible to describe the structure of this document to some program
so that it can present a nice interface to the human so the human can
change the file. Perhaps the interface would be 
<code>antialias = yes|no</code>. Brilliant! Or perhaps that could have been the
format of this file, and there wouldn't have been a need for a fucking
meta-document to begin with.</p>

<p>Then comes the actual document, and this is where things truly become
stupid. Just bask in the glory of this section:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;edit name="antialias" mode="assign"&gt;&lt;bool&gt;true&lt;/bool&gt;&lt;/edit&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Seriously.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bool&gt;true&lt;/bool&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Wow. I hate you so much.</p>

<p>You are seriously writing an AST here, in XML. This is the internal
representation of a parser, written our laboriously, after the parser
read the statement <code>antialias = true</code>. This is insane! Why, why would
anyone come up with this file format, and not go "Wait a second. This
is retarded. Why don't I just write antialias = true and <em>parse</em> it
when reading the configuration file."</p>

<p>Not that this idiotic fucking XML format doesn't require parsing. In
fact, I'm sure that most of the 60 seconds it takes my Ubuntu box to
start is spent parsing fucking XML documents!</p>

<h1 id="softwareplatform">software platform</h1>

<p>I'm not going to go into this bit too much, because it's abuntantly
clear that going down the route of writing software in XML is an
idiotic idea (see previous example). Of course <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Application_Markup_Language">Microsoft</a> would be the
ones to give it a go.</p>

<p>I don't even know where to begin here. Just reading the short
description of XAML on the wikipedia page makes me vomit.</p>

<h1 id="databaseformat">database format</h1>

<p>Just like the instigators of XML had no idea what a markup language
should look like or what is the appropriate way of expressing
communication across a network, so they had never heard of
databases. Thus, the idea of using XML to store data was born, and
carried proudly on the shoulders of millions of idiots, singing and
drooling happily on Youtube comment pages across the world.</p>

<p>There will never be a way to simplify something through the
introduction of further layers of abstraction. Your XML document is
not made more portable by creating a schema for it, or putting your
tags into a namespace, or any of the other crazy ideas that have
been adopted enthusiastically by village idiots everywhere. </p>

<p>Here's a hint: Don't use XML. It is NEVER THE RIGHT SOLUTION.</p>
